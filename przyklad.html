&lt;dave: hey so what sort of insane loot did you rake in today&gt;
&lt;john: i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.&gt;
&lt;dave: oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here&gt;
&lt;john: ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?&gt;
&lt;dave: but 
the seal on the bottle is unbroken 
are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory&gt;
&lt;john: all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle? 
try using your brain numbnuts.&gt;
&lt;dave: why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like 
i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous&gt;
&lt;john: it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.&gt;
&lt;dave: ok i can accept that 
monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters 
also fred savage has a really punchable face 
but who cares about this lets stop talking about it 
did you get the beta yet&gt;
&lt;john: no. 
did you?&gt; 
&lt;dave: man i got two copies already 
but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring 
did you see how it got slammed in game bro????&gt;
&lt;john: game bro is a joke and we both know it.&gt;
&lt;dave: yeah
